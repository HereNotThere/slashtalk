Disable `installAppDeps` in electron-builder. Bun isn't a drop-in npm replacement here — electron-builder's app-deps step invokes `node /path/to/bun` which fails with `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` on the Bun binary. Vite already bundles all production code into `out/`, so there's nothing to install.
